However, due to severely compromised pulmonary lung function, only one-third of these patients are eligible organ donors with far fewer capable of donating lungs (~20%). As a result of this organ scarcity, understanding and controlling the pulmonary pathophysiology of potential donors is key to improving the health and long-term success of transplanted lungs. Recent Advances: Although the exact mechanism by which TBI produces pulmonary pathophysiology remains unclear it may be related to the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from the injured tissue. These heterogeneous endogenous host molecules can be rapidly released from damaged or dying cells and mediate sterile inflammation following trauma. In this review, we highlight the interaction of the DAMP, high-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) with the receptor for advanced glycation-end products (RAGE) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Critical Issues: Recently published studies are reviewed, implicating the release of HMGB1 as producing marked changes in pulmonary inflammation and physiology following trauma followed by an overview of the experimental evidence demonstrating the benefits of blocking the HMGB1-RAGE axis. Future Directions: Targeting the HMGB1 signaling axis may increase the number of lungs available for transplantation and improve long-term benefits for organ recipient patient outcomes.", "abstract_source": "pubmed", "context": {"all": {"count": 18954860, "mean": 9.6152123766678, "rank": 2597360, "pct": 86, "higher_than": 16325766}, "journal": {"count": 1688, "mean": 5.4010710900474, "rank": 159, "pct": 90, "higher_than": 1523}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 273003, "mean": 10.296842825903, "rank": 44607, "pct": 83, "higher_than": 227718}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 32, "mean": 5.266, "rank": 6, "pct": 84, "higher_than": 27}}, "authors": ["Daniel J.
