The role of mast cells in AD is not completely understood. To define the effects of mast cells on skin biology, we observed that mast cells regulate the homeostatic expression of Epidermal Differentiation Complex (EDC) and other skin genes. Decreased EDC gene expression in mice that genetically lack mast cells (Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice) is associated with increased uptake of protein antigens painted on the skin by dendritic cells, compared to similarly treated wild-type mice, suggesting a protective role for mast cells in exposure to nominal environmental allergens. To test this further, we crossed Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice with Stat6VT transgenic mice that develop spontaneous AD-like disease that is dependent on Th2 cytokines and associated with high serum concentrations of IgE. We observed that Stat6VT x Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice developed more frequent and more severe allergic skin inflammation than Stat6VT transgenic mice that had mast cells. Together, these studies suggest that mast cells regulate epidermal barrier function and have a potential protective role in the development of AD-like disease.", "context": {"all": {"count": 12246729, "mean": 7.587715972942, "rank": 7040201, "pct": 40, "higher_than": 4969939}, "journal": {"count": 6321, "mean": 6.2340930379747, "rank": 4897, "pct": 21, "higher_than": 1331}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 280314, "mean": 11.334352969715, "rank": 131876, "pct": 49, "higher_than": 139606}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 104, "mean": 13.75386407767, "rank": 41, "pct": 50, "higher_than": 53}}, "authors": ["Sarita Sehra", "Ana P.M.
