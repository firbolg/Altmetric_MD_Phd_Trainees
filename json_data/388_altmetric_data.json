These lipids mediate systemic immunosuppression in a process involving IL-10. The current studies sought to determine the functional significance of UVB-mediated systemic immunosuppression in an established model of murine melanoma. We show that UVB irradiation augments B16F10 tumor growth and is dependent on host, but not melanoma cell; PAF-R-expression as UVB or the PAF-R agonist, carbamoyl PAF (CPAF), both promote B16F10 tumor growth in wild-type (WT) mice, independent of whether B16F10 cells express PAF-Rs, but do not augment tumor growth in Pafr -/- mice. UVB-mediated augmentation of experimental murine tumor growth was inhibited with antioxidants, demonstrating the importance of Ox-GPC PAF-R agonists produced non-enzymatically. Host immune cells are required as CPAF-induced augmentation of tumor growth which is not seen in immunodeficient NOD SCID mice. Finally, depleting antibodies against IL-10 in WT mice or depletion of CD25-positive cells in FoxP3(EGFP) transgenic mice block UVB and/or CPAF-induced tumor growth supporting a requirement for IL-10 and Tregs in this process. These findings indicate that UVB-generated Ox-GPCs with PAF-R agonistic activity enhance experimental murine melanoma tumor growth through targeting host immune cells, most notably Tregs, to mediate systemic immunosuppression.", "abstract_source": "pubmed", "context": {"all": {"count": 4507280, "mean": 5.1336924524522, "rank": 960855, "pct": 78, "higher_than": 3522961}, "journal": {"count": 1087, "mean": 4.2918103130755, "rank": 155, "pct": 84, "higher_than": 919}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 75898, "mean": 4.5532393375232, "rank": 15420, "pct": 79, "higher_than": 60062}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 41, "mean": 2.94145, "rank": 4, "pct": 90, "higher_than": 37}}, "authors": ["Ravi P.
