Higher than physiological oxygen levels impede the development of the immature retinal neuropil and vasculature. Current treatment regimens include cryotherapy, laser photocoagulation, and anti-VEGF agents. Unfortunately, none of these approaches can rescue the normal retinal vasculature, and each has significant safety concerns. The limitations of these approaches have led to new efforts to understand the pathological characteristics in each phase of ROP and to find a safer and more effective therapeutic approach. In the era of stem cell biology and with the need for new treatments for ROP, this review discusses the possible future use of unique populations of proangiogenic cells for therapeutic revascularization of the preterm retina.", "authors": ["Maria Grant", "Thao Le Phuong Trinh", "Sergio Li Calzi", "Lynn Shaw", "Mervin Yoder"], "type": "article", "handles": [], "altmetric_id": 8299244, "schema": "1.5.4", "is_oa": false, "cited_by_posts_count": 2, "cited_by_tweeters_count": 2, "cited_by_accounts_count": 2, "last_updated": 1464357955, "score": 1, "history": {"1y": 0, "6m": 0, "3m": 0, "1m": 0, "1w": 0, "6d": 0, "5d": 0, "4d": 0, "3d": 0, "2d": 0, "1d": 0, "at": 1}, "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/eb.s94451", "added_on": 1464319712, "published_on": 1462060800, "readers": {"citeulike": "0", "mendeley": "20", "connotea": "0"}, "readers_count": 20, "images": {"small": "https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=1&types=tttttttt", "medium": "https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=1&types=tttttttt", "large": "https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=1&types=tttttttt"}, "details_url": "http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=8299244"}
