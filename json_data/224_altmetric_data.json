Molecular imaging can provide an early noninvasive phenotype, but small samples have prohibited genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of cortical A\u03b2 load until now. We employed florbetapir ((18)F) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to assess brain A\u03b2 levels in vivo for 555 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). More than six million common genetic variants were tested for association to quantitative global cortical A\u03b2 load controlling for age, gender and diagnosis. Independent genome-wide significant associations were identified on chromosome 19 within APOE (apolipoprotein E) (rs429358, P=5.5 \u00d7 10(-14)) and on chromosome 3 upstream of BCHE (butyrylcholinesterase) (rs509208, P=2.7 \u00d7 10(-8)) in a region previously associated with serum BCHE activity. Together, these loci explained 15% of the variance in cortical A\u03b2 levels in this sample (APOE 10.7%, BCHE 4.3%). Suggestive associations were identified within ITGA6, near EFNA5, EDIL3, ITGA1, PIK3R1, NFIB and ARID1B, and between NUAK1 and C12orf75. These results confirm the association of APOE with A\u03b2 deposition and represent the largest known effect of BCHE on an AD-related phenotype. BCHE has been found in senile plaques and this new association of genetic variation at the BCHE locus with A\u03b2 burden in humans may have implications for potential disease-modifying effects of BCHE-modulating agents in the AD spectrum.", "abstract_source": "pubmed", "context": {"all": {"count": 18763644, "mean": 9.5631395466709, "rank": 1336251, "pct": 92, "higher_than": 17428115}, "journal": {"count": 3439, "mean": 30.616840942134, "rank": 951, "pct": 72, "higher_than": 2488}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 163259, "mean": 7.9627057865112, "rank": 11664, "pct": 92, "higher_than": 151593}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 46, "mean": 14.29652173913, "rank": 8, "pct": 84, "higher_than": 39}}, "authors": ["V K Ramanan", "S L Risacher", "K Nho", "S Kim", "S Swaminathan", "L Shen", "T M Foroud", "H Hakonarson", "M J Huentelman", "P S Aisen", "R C Petersen", "R C Green", "C R Jack", "R A Koeppe", "W J Jagust", "M W Weiner", "A J Saykin"], "type": "article", "altmetric_id": 1247980, "schema": "1.5.4", "is_oa": false, "publisher_subjects": [{"name": "Medical And Health Sciences", "scheme": "era"}, {"name": "Biological Sciences", "scheme": "era"}, {"name": "Psychology And Cognitive Sciences", "scheme": "era"}], "cited_by_feeds_count": 1, "cited_by_gplus_count": 1, "cited_by_posts_count": 8, "cited_by_tweeters_count": 5, "cited_by_msm_count": 1, "cited_by_accounts_count": 8, "last_updated": 1627656349, "score": 18.296, "history": {"1y": 7, "6m": 7, "3m": 7, "1m": 0, "1w": 0, "6d": 0, "5d": 0, "4d": 0, "3d": 0, "2d": 0, "1d": 0, "at": 18.296}, "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/mp.2013.19", "added_on": 1361278611, "published_on": 1361232000, "subjects": ["molecularbiology", "psychiatry"], "scopus_subjects": ["Neuroscience", "Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology", "Life Sciences", "Medicine", "Health Sciences"], "readers": {"citeulike": "0", "mendeley": "154", "connotea": "0"}, "readers_count": 154, "images": {"small": "https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=19&types=mbtttttg", "medium": "https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=19&types=mbtttttg", "large": "https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=19&types=mbtttttg"}, "details_url": "http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1247980"}
