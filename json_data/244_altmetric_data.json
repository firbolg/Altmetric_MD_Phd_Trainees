Previous studies revealed that INPP5E, the inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase mutated in the developmental disorders Joubert and MORM syndromes, is essential for the function of the primary cilium and maintenance of phosphoinositide balance in non-dividing cells. Here, we report that INPP5E further contributes to cellular homeostasis by regulating cell division. We found that silencing or genetic knockout of INPP5E in human and murine cells impairs the spindle assembly checkpoint, centrosome and spindle function, and maintenance of chromosomal integrity. Consistent with a cell cycle regulatory role, we found that INPP5E expression is cell cycle-dependent, peaking at mitotic entry. INPP5E localized to centrosomes, chromosomes and kinetochores in early mitosis, and shuttles to the midzone spindle at mitotic exit. Our findings identify the previously unknown, essential role of INPP5E in mitosis and prevention of aneuploidy, providing a new perspective on the function of this phosphoinositide phosphatase in health and development.", "context": {"all": {"count": 16202841, "mean": 9.160626458081, "rank": 12355681, "pct": 20, "higher_than": 3333081}, "journal": {"count": 10078, "mean": 4.1615052098839, "rank": 9285, "pct": 6, "higher_than": 687}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 263362, "mean": 14.696637869691, "rank": 180823, "pct": 26, "higher_than": 69056}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 46, "mean": 1.43, "rank": 29, "pct": 30, "higher_than": 14}}, "authors": ["Elizabeth A.
