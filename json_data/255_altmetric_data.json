We recently discovered phosphorylation of a tyrosine (Y102) in bovine PV E2. To identify the responsible factor, we tested several candidate tyrosine kinases that are highly expressed in keratinocytes for binding to BPV-1 E2. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) co-immunoprecipitated with the BPV-1 E2 protein, as did HPV-31 E2, which also co-localized with FGFR3 within the nucleus. A constitutively active mutant form of FGFR3 decreased BPV-1 and HPV-31 transient replication, though this result also occurred in a BPV-1 E2 mutant lacking a previous phosphorylation site of interest (Y102). Furthermore, FGFR3 depletion in cell lines that maintain HPV-31 episomes increased viral copy number. These results suggest that FGFR3 kinase activity may regulate the PV reproductive program through phosphorylation of the E2 protein, although this is unlikely to occur through the Y102 residue of HPV E2.IMPORTANCE The papillomavirus (PV) is a double stranded DNA tumor virus infecting cervix, mouth, and throat tissues. The viral protein E2 is responsible for the replication of the virus. Understanding the mechanisms of the replicative life cycle of the virus may bring to light direct targets and treatments against viral infection. We recently found that the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) interacts with and mediates PV E2 function through phosphorylation of the E2 protein. Our study suggests that the function of the E2 protein may be regulated through a direct FGFR3 target during the maintenance stage of the PV life cycle.", "context": {"all": {"count": 11618931, "mean": 7.4103275526955, "rank": 239127, "pct": 97, "higher_than": 11379512}, "journal": {"count": 12575, "mean": 4.8277765229839, "rank": 102, "pct": 99, "higher_than": 12472}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 238483, "mean": 13.699933252824, "rank": 11705, "pct": 95, "higher_than": 226771}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 157, "mean": 6.8059230769231, "rank": 6, "pct": 96, "higher_than": 151}}, "authors": ["Fang Xie", "Marsha DeSmet", "Sriramana Kanginakudru", "Leny Jose", "Sara P.
