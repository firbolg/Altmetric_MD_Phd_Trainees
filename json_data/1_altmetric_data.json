Having previously shown that cigarette smoke (CS) extract disrupts the lung microvasculature barrier function by endothelial cell activation and cytoskeletal rearrangement, we investigated the contribution of nicotine in CS or e-cigarette extracts (e-Cig) to lung endothelial injury. Primary lung microvascular endothelial cells were exposed to nicotine, e-Cig solution, or condensed e-Cig vapor (1-20 mM nicotine) or to nicotine-free CS extract or e-Cig solutions. Compared to nicotine-containing, nicotine free-CS extract (10-20%) caused significantly less endothelial permeability, as measured with electric cell-substrate impedance sensing. Nicotine exposures triggered dose-dependent loss of endothelial barrier in cultured cell monolayers and rapidly increased lung inflammation and oxidative stress in mice. The endothelial barrier disruptive effects were associated with increased intracellular ceramides, p38 MAPK activation, myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation and was critically mediated by Rho-activated kinase via inhibition of MLC-phosphatase unit MYPT1. Although nicotine at sufficient concentrations to cause endothelial barrier loss did not trigger cell necrosis, it markedly inhibited cell proliferation. Augmentation of sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P) signaling via S1P1 improved both endothelial cell proliferation and barrier function during nicotine exposures. Additional nicotine-independent effects of e-Cig may be attributable to acrolein, which was detected, along with propylene glycol, glycerol, and nicotine, by NMR, mass spectrometry, and gas chromatography, in both e-Cig solutions and vapor. These results suggest that soluble components of e-Cig, including nicotine cause dose-dependent loss of lung endothelial barrier function, associated with oxidative stress and brisk inflammation.", "context": {"all": {"count": 19019810, "mean": 9.6333483046376, "rank": 220092, "pct": 98, "higher_than": 18801331}, "journal": {"count": 2121, "mean": 5.6908486562942, "rank": 12, "pct": 99, "higher_than": 2109}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 243852, "mean": 9.779406968161, "rank": 3118, "pct": 98, "higher_than": 240734}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 47, "mean": 2.0082978723404, "rank": 1, "pct": 99, "higher_than": 47}}, "authors": ["Kelly S.
