To develop mechanistic relationships between bTBI and post-blast neurological sequelae, it is imperative to characterize the initiating traumatic mechanical events leading to eventual alterations of cell, tissue, and organ structure and function. This paper presents a wireless sensing system capable of monitoring the intracranial brain deformation in real-time during the event of a bTBI. The system consists of an implantable soft magnet and an external head-mounted magnetic sensor that is able to measure the field in three dimensions. The change in the relative position of the soft magnet WITH respect to the external sensor as the result of the blast wave induces changes in the magnetic field. The magnetic field data in turn is used to extract the temporal and spatial motion of the brain under the blast wave in real-time. The system has temporal and spatial resolutions of 5\u2009\u03bcs and 10\u2009\u03bcm. Following the characterization and validation of the sensor system, we measured brain deformations in a live rodent during a bTBI.", "context": {"all": {"count": 8148366, "mean": 6.8920487793494, "rank": 603811, "pct": 92, "higher_than": 7544783}, "journal": {"count": 33834, "mean": 14.891849023143, "rank": 4984, "pct": 85, "higher_than": 28851}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 294310, "mean": 9.006748036927, "rank": 28914, "pct": 90, "higher_than": 265396}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 2246, "mean": 14.696993318486, "rank": 323, "pct": 85, "higher_than": 1923}}, "authors": ["S.
