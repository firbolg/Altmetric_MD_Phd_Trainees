The sarco endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase 2b (SERCA2b) pump maintains a steep Ca(2+) gradient between the cytosol and ER lumen. In models of diabetes, our data demonstrated loss of \u03b2 cell Pdx-1 that occurs in parallel with altered SERCA2b expression, while in silico analysis of the SERCA2b promoter revealed multiple putative Pdx-1 binding sites. We hypothesized that Pdx-1 loss under inflammatory and diabetic conditions leads to decreased SERCA2b levels and activity with concomitant alterations in ER health. To test this, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Pdx-1 was performed in INS-1 cells. Results revealed reduced SERCA2b expression and decreased ER Ca(2+), which was measured using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. Co-transfection of human Pdx-1 with a reporter fused to the human SERCA2 promoter increased luciferase activity 3-4 fold relative to an empty vector control, and direct binding of Pdx-1 to the proximal SERCA2 promoter was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. To determine whether restoration of SERCA2b could rescue ER stress induced by Pdx-1 loss, Pdx1+/- mice were fed a high fat diet. Isolated islets demonstrated an increased spliced-to-total Xbp1 ratio, while SERCA2b overexpression reduced the Xbp1 ratio to that of wild-type controls. Together, these results identify SERCA2b as a novel transcriptional target of Pdx-1 and define a role for altered ER Ca(2+) regulation in Pdx-1 deficient states.", "abstract_source": "pubmed", "authors": ["Justin S.
