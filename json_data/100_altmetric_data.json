Although there is a strong correlation in humans between cEAT volume and CAD severity, there remains a paucity of experimental data demonstrating a causal link of cEAT to CAD. The current study tested the hypothesis that surgical resection of\u00a0cEAT attenuates inflammation and CAD progression.\nFemale Ossabaw miniature swine (n\u00a0= 12) were fed an atherogenic diet for 8 months and randomly allocated into sham (n\u00a0= 5) or adipectomy (n\u00a0= 7) groups. Both groups underwent a thoracotomy, opening of the pericardial sac, and placement of radioopaque clips to mark the proximal left anterior descending artery. Adipectomy swine underwent removal of 1 to 1.5 cm(2) of cEAT from the proximal artery. After sham or adipectomy, CAD severity was assessed with intravascular ultrasonography. Swine recovered for an additional 3 months on an atherogenic diet, and CAD was assessed immediately before euthanasia. Artery sections were processed for histologic and immunohistochemical analysis.\nSeverity of CAD as assessed by percent stenosis was reduced in the adipectomy cohort compared with shams; however, plaque size remained unaltered, whereas larger plaque sizes developed in sham-operated swine. Adipectomy resulted in an expanded arterial diameter, similar to the Glagov phenomenon of positive outward remodeling. No differences in inflammatory marker expression were observed.\nThese data indicate that cEAT resection did not alter inflammatory marker expression, but arrested CAD progression through increased positive outward remodeling and arrest of atherogenesis.", "context": {"all": {"count": 12293936, "mean": 7.6095534733028, "rank": 9818772, "pct": 11, "higher_than": 1399109}, "journal": {"count": 4846, "mean": 4.9109453044376, "rank": 4021, "pct": 8, "higher_than": 434}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 264585, "mean": 13.243964601034, "rank": 189869, "pct": 15, "higher_than": 41828}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 150, "mean": 6.7178791946309, "rank": 112, "pct": 18, "higher_than": 27}}, "authors": ["Mikaela L.
