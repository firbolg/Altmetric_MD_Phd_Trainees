Although in vitro studies have indicated that SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP-2) is a signaling factor critical for regulating sympathetic neuron differentiation, this has yet to be shown in the complex in vivo environment of cardiac autonomic innervation. Targeting SHP-2 within postmigratory NC lineages resulted in a fully penetrant mouse model of diminished sympathetic cardiac innervation and concomitant bradycardia. Immunohistochemistry of the sympathetic nerve marker tyrosine hydroxylase revealed a progressive loss of adrenergic ganglionic neurons and reduction of cardiac sympathetic axon density in Shp2 cKOs. Molecularly, Shp2 cKOs exhibit lineage-specific suppression of activated phospo-ERK1/2 signaling but not of other downstream targets of SHP-2 such as pAKT. Genetic restoration of the phosphorylated-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) deficiency via lineage-specific expression of constitutively active MEK1 was sufficient to rescue the sympathetic innervation deficit and its physiological consequences. These data indicate that SHP-2 signaling specifically through pERK in postmigratory NC lineages is essential for development and maintenance of sympathetic cardiac innervation postnatally.", "abstract_source": "pubmed", "context": {"all": {"count": 12365166, "mean": 7.626546511092, "rank": 1891247, "pct": 83, "higher_than": 10365135}, "journal": {"count": 77340, "mean": 22.047940806062, "rank": 26307, "pct": 64, "higher_than": 50117}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 197152, "mean": 7.7762642238693, "rank": 32683, "pct": 82, "higher_than": 162909}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 1087, "mean": 40.593850828729, "rank": 582, "pct": 46, "higher_than": 504}}, "authors": ["J.
