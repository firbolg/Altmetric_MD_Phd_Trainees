A search for all major databases and relevant journals from inception to April 2015 without restriction on languages was performed.\nA total of 859 patients from seven randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. Similar pooled outcome was demonstrated in terms of oral PPI versus intravenous PPI in the rate of recurrent bleeding within a 30-day of follow-up period (risk ratio\u2009=\u20090.90; 95%CI: 0.58, 1.39; P\u2009=\u20090.62; I(2) \u2009=\u20090%). In terms of the rate of mortality, both oral and intravenous PPIs showed similar outcomes, and the pooled risk ratio was 0.88 (95%CI: 0.29, 2.71; P\u2009=\u20090.82; I(2) \u2009=\u20090%). Likewise, no significant difference was detected in blood transfusion and hospital stay, and the pooled mean differences were -0.14 (95%CI: -0.39, 0.12; P\u2009=\u20090.29; I(2) \u2009=\u200932%) and -0.60 (95%CI: -1.42, 0.23; P\u2009=\u20090.16; I(2) \u2009=\u200979%) respectively.\nOur results suggest that the effectiveness of oral PPI is a feasible, safe alternative to intravenous PPI in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers. Oral PPI may be able to replace intravenous PPI as the treatment of choice in peptic ulcer bleeding. This article is protected by copyright.
