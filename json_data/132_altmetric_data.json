NF1 results from heritable or spontaneous mutations of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene. NF1 encodes the protein neurofibromin, which functions to negatively regulate Ras-activity. Approximately 50\u00a0% of NF1 patients develop osteopenia or osteoporosis, resulting in significantly increased rates of long-bone fracture and morbidity. While defective osteoblast bone anabolism has been implicated as a central factor in the pathogenesis of NF1 associated skeletal deficits, recent data suggest that NF1 (Nf1) haploinsufficiency within the hematopoietic compartment, particularly in osteoclasts and myeloid progenitors, plays a pivotal role in engendering NF1 osseous manifestations. In this chapter, we review the latest data from clinical studies and murine models delineating a critical role for hematopoietic compartment, myeloid progenitors of NF1 (Nf1) haploinsufficient and their progeny-osteoclasts, in the pathogenesis of NF1 associated osteopenia/osteoporosis and discuss putative targets for future therapeutics.", "context": {"all": {"count": 13029776, "mean": 7.9321694549455, "rank": 11577756, "pct": 1, "higher_than": 0}, "journal": {"count": 333, "mean": 2.6856024096386, "rank": 273, "pct": 1, "higher_than": 0}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 266299, "mean": 11.341783498186, "rank": 222991, "pct": 1, "higher_than": 0}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 12, "mean": 1.8, "rank": 11, "pct": 1, "higher_than": 0}}, "authors": ["Steven D.
