Since these drugs are excreted unmetabolized through the kidney, they are not recommended for individuals with compromised kidney function due to concerns of kidney and bone toxicity. The goal of this paper is to summarize the preclinical BP work in models of kidney disease with particular focus on the bone, kidney, and vasculature.\nSummative data exists showing positive effects on bone and vascular calcifications with minimal evidence for bone or kidney toxicity in animal models. Preclinical data suggest it may be worthwhile to take a step back and reconsider the use of bisphosphonates to lessen skeletal/vascular complications associated with compromised kidney function.", "context": {"all": {"count": 10152716, "mean": 7.4595741747793, "rank": 8877140, "pct": 1, "higher_than": 0}, "journal": {"count": 271, "mean": 2.6398888888889, "rank": 202, "pct": 1, "higher_than": 0}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 264309, "mean": 12.870742308216, "rank": 219742, "pct": 1, "higher_than": 0}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 26, "mean": 1.5732, "rank": 20, "pct": 1, "higher_than": 0}}, "authors": ["Matthew R.
