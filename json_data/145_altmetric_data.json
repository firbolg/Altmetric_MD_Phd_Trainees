Using RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we previously reported that ~12% of PDACs have an angiogenesis gene signature with increased expression of multiple pro-angiogenic genes. By analyzing the recently expanded TCGA dataset, we now report that this signature is present in ~35% of PDACs but that it is mostly distinct from an angiogenesis signature present in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). These PDACs exhibit a transcriptome that reflects active TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and up-regulation of several pro-inflammatory genes, and many members of JAK signaling pathways. Moreover, expression of SMAD4 and HDAC9 correlates with endothelial cell abundance in PDAC tissues. Concomitantly targeting the TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor (T\u03b2RI) kinase with SB505124 and JAK1-2 with ruxolitinib suppresses JAK1 phosphorylation and blocks proliferative cross-talk between human pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) and human endothelial cells (ECs), and these anti-proliferative effects were mimicked by JAK1 silencing in ECs. By contrast, either inhibitor alone does not suppress their enhanced proliferation in 3D co-cultures. These findings suggest that targeting both TGF-\u03b2 and JAK1 signaling could be explored therapeutically in the 35% of PDAC patients whose cancers exhibit an angiogenesis gene signature.", "context": {"all": {"count": 17575102, "mean": 9.4134159747134, "rank": 10984455, "pct": 35, "higher_than": 6222533}, "journal": {"count": 13465, "mean": 4.4613284812477, "rank": 4690, "pct": 60, "higher_than": 8200}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 374067, "mean": 9.4580376563551, "rank": 190719, "pct": 45, "higher_than": 171083}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 766, "mean": 2.4179242819843, "rank": 268, "pct": 58, "higher_than": 445}}, "authors": ["Kelly E.
