To better understand the role of DPP4 regulation of hematopoiesis, we analyzed the activity of DPP4 on the surface of immature blood cells and then comparatively assessed the interactions and functional effects of full-length (FL) and DPP4 truncated factors [(T)-GM-CSF and- IL-3] on both in vitro and in vivo models of normal and leukemic cells. T-GM-CSF and T-IL-3 had enhanced receptor binding, but decreased CSF activity, compared to their FL forms. Importantly, T-GM-CSF and T-IL-3 significantly, and reciprocally, blunted receptor binding and myeloid progenitor cell proliferation activity of both FL-GM-CSF and FL-IL-3 in vitro and in vivo. Similar effects were apparent in vitro using cluster forming cells from patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) regardless of cytogenetic or molecular alterations and in vivo utilizing animal models of leukemia. This suggests that DPP4 T-molecules have modified binding and functions compared to their FL counterparts and may serve regulatory roles in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.Leukemia accepted article preview online, 27 March 2017. doi:10.1038/leu.2017.98.", "context": {"all": {"count": 9264233, "mean": 7.5814585258537, "rank": 6720990, "pct": 23, "higher_than": 2204493}, "journal": {"count": 2020, "mean": 5.9321872213967, "rank": 1494, "pct": 22, "higher_than": 451}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 259767, "mean": 13.425682622052, "rank": 172428, "pct": 27, "higher_than": 71831}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 74, "mean": 7.6809863013699, "rank": 48, "pct": 28, "higher_than": 21}}, "authors": ["H A O\u2019Leary", "M Capitano", "S Cooper", "C Mantel", "H S Boswell", "R Kapur", "B Ramdas", "R Chan", "L Deng", "C-K Qu", "H E Broxmeyer"], "type": "article", "handles": [], "altmetric_id": 18186957, "schema": "1.5.4", "is_oa": false, "publisher_subjects": [{"name": "Clinical Sciences", "scheme": "era"}, {"name": "Oncology And Carcinogenesis", "scheme": "era"}], "cited_by_posts_count": 3, "cited_by_tweeters_count": 3, "cited_by_accounts_count": 3, "last_updated": 1490800644, "score": 0.75, "history": {"1y": 0, "6m": 0, "3m": 0, "1m": 0, "1w": 0, "6d": 0, "5d": 0, "4d": 0, "3d": 0, "2d": 0, "1d": 0, "at": 0.75}, "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/leu.2017.98", "added_on": 1490696903, "published_on": 1490572800, "subjects": ["hematology", "neoplasms"], "scopus_subjects": ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology", "Life Sciences", "Medicine", "Health Sciences"], "readers": {"citeulike": "0", "mendeley": "9", "connotea": "0"}, "readers_count": 9, "images": {"small": "https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=1&types=tttttttt", "medium": "https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=1&types=tttttttt", "large": "https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=1&types=tttttttt"}, "details_url": "http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=18186957"}
