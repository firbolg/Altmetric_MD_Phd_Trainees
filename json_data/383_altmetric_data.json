Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas we demonstrate that a subset of PDACs exhibits a strong pro-angiogenic signature that includes 37 genes, such as HDAC9, that are overexpressed in PDAC arising in KRC mice, which express mutated Kras and lack RB. Moreover, patient-derived orthotopic xenografts can exhibit tumor angiogenesis, whereas conditioned media (CM) from KRC-derived pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) enhance endothelial cell (EC) growth and migration, and activate canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling and STAT3. Inhibition of the type I TGF-\u03b2 receptor with SB505124 does not alter endothelial activation in vitro, but decreases pro-angiogenic gene expression and suppresses angiogenesis in vivo. Conversely, STAT3 silencing or JAK1-2 inhibition with ruxolitinib blocks CM-enhanced EC proliferation. STAT3 disruption also suppresses endothelial HDAC9 and blocks CM-induced HDAC9 expression, whereas HDAC9 re-expression restores CM-enhanced endothelial proliferation. Moreover, ruxolitinib blocks mitogenic EC/PCC cross-talk, and suppresses endothelial p-STAT3 and HDAC9, and PDAC progression and angiogenesis in vivo, while markedly prolonging survival of KRC mice. Thus, targeting JAK1-2 with ruxolitinib blocks a final pathway that is common to multiple pro-angiogenic factors, suppresses EC-mediated PCC proliferation, and may be useful in PDACs with a strong pro-angiogenic signature.", "abstract_source": "pubmed", "context": {"all": {"count": 15033985, "mean": 8.6739311505106, "rank": 11965035, "pct": 11, "higher_than": 1753814}, "journal": {"count": 12685, "mean": 3.9944172185431, "rank": 6354, "pct": 31, "higher_than": 4043}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 222560, "mean": 9.9996120309671, "rank": 155758, "pct": 17, "higher_than": 38444}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 317, "mean": 3.1885632911392, "rank": 162, "pct": 30, "higher_than": 97}}, "authors": ["Jesse Gore", "Kelly E.
