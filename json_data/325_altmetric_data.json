Additional alkanethiol was physisorbed onto the NP treated devices to distinguish between the effects of the Au NPs and alkanethiols on HEMT operation. Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy and electrical measurements were used to characterize the treatment effects. The HEMTs were operated near threshold voltage due to the greatest sensitivity in this region. The Au NP/HEMT system electrically detected functional group differences on adsorbed NPs which is pertinent to biosensor applications.", "abstract_source": "pubmed", "context": {"all": {"count": 12360893, "mean": 7.6267276715818, "rank": 9868511, "pct": 11, "higher_than": 1407306}, "journal": {"count": 27316, "mean": 4.478571627311, "rank": 22929, "pct": 9, "higher_than": 2576}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 170977, "mean": 7.7407005544641, "rank": 115138, "pct": 16, "higher_than": 27687}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 56, "mean": 6.3054909090909, "rank": 44, "pct": 12, "higher_than": 7}}, "authors": ["M.
