The pleiotropic cytokine IL-6 has previously been linked to \u03b2-cell autophagy but has not been studied in the context of \u03b2-cell antioxidant response. We used a combination of animal models of diabetes and analysis of cultured human islets and rodent \u03b2-cells to study how IL-6 influences antioxidant response. We show that IL-6 couples autophagy to antioxidant response to reduce \u03b2-cell and human islet ROS. \u03b2 cell-specific loss of IL-6 signaling in vivo renders mice more susceptible to oxidative damage and cell death by the selective \u03b2-cell toxins streptozotocin and alloxan. IL-6-driven ROS reduction is associated with an increase in the master antioxidant factor NRF2, which rapidly translocates to the mitochondria to decrease mitochondrial activity and stimulate mitophagy. IL-6 also initiates a robust transient drop in cellular cAMP, likely contributing to the stimulation of mitophagy for ROS mitigation. Our findings suggest that coupling autophagy to antioxidant response in the \u03b2 cell leads to stress adaptation that can reduce cellular apoptosis. These findings have implications for \u03b2-cell survival under diabetogenic conditions and present novel targets for therapeutic intervention.", "context": {"all": {"count": 19015416, "mean": 9.6305310810987, "rank": 1840915, "pct": 90, "higher_than": 17173311}, "journal": {"count": 8597, "mean": 8.4049835989299, "rank": 927, "pct": 89, "higher_than": 7669}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 292956, "mean": 14.465250242356, "rank": 44916, "pct": 84, "higher_than": 247972}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 228, "mean": 14.396964912281, "rank": 36, "pct": 84, "higher_than": 193}}, "authors": ["Michelle R.
