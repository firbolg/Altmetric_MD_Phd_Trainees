One effective but under-explored possibility for IPE is through student-led clinics, which now exist in the majority of medical schools. This short report presents the Indiana University Student Outreach Clinic (IU-SOC), which involves seven different professional programs across three institutions, as a model for how IPE can be delivered formally through service learning. Lessons learned, such as nurturing an intentional interprofessional program, structured orientation and reflection, and resource and knowledge sharing between the clinic and academic institutions, can be applied to all student-led clinics, but also can inform other IPE initiatives in health professional curricula.", "abstract_source": "pubmed", "context": {"all": {"count": 5036026, "mean": 5.9656490211997, "rank": 780887, "pct": 84, "higher_than": 4251633}, "journal": {"count": 427, "mean": 3.3262863849765, "rank": 54, "pct": 87, "higher_than": 373}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 177269, "mean": 8.3330085745877, "rank": 33506, "pct": 81, "higher_than": 143625}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 22, "mean": 5.0595238095238, "rank": 8, "pct": 63, "higher_than": 14}}, "authors": ["Janice L.
