It has not been determined whether Th9 cells express a characteristic transcriptional signature. In this study, we performed microarray analysis to identify genes enriched in Th9 cells compared with other Th subsets. This analysis defined a transcriptional regulatory network required for the expression of a subset of Th9-enriched genes. The activator protein 1 (AP1) family transcription factor BATF (B cell, activating transcription factor\u2013like) was among the genes enriched in Th9 cells and was required for the expression of IL-9 and other Th9-associated genes in both human and mouse T cells. The expression of BATF was increased in Th9 cultures derived from atopic infants compared with Th9 cultures from control infants. T cells deficient in BATF expression had a diminished capacity to promote allergic inflammation compared with wild-type controls. Moreover, mouse Th9 cells ectopically expressing BATF were more efficient at promoting allergic inflammation than control transduced cells. These data indicate that BATF is a central regulator of the Th9 phenotype and contributes to the development of allergic inflammation.", "abstract_source": "pubmed", "context": {"all": {"count": 3627464, "mean": 4.9483847763613, "rank": 289545, "pct": 91, "higher_than": 3324762}, "journal": {"count": 4192, "mean": 9.1372526843236, "rank": 987, "pct": 74, "higher_than": 3106}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 92181, "mean": 7.3455229333913, "rank": 9909, "pct": 88, "higher_than": 81977}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 39, "mean": 14.580052631579, "rank": 13, "pct": 64, "higher_than": 25}}, "authors": ["Rukhsana Jabeen", "Ritobrata Goswami", "Olufolakemi Awe", "Aishwarya Kulkarni", "Evelyn T.
