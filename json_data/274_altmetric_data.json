In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of fMRI data within the white matter acquired from humans in the resting state or watching a naturalistic movie. By using independent component analysis and hierarchical clustering, resting-state fMRI data in the white matter were denoised and decomposed into spatially independent components, further assembled into hierarchically organized axonal fiber bundles. Interestingly, such components were partly reorganized during natural vision. Relative to the resting state, the visual task specifically induced a stronger degree of temporal coherence within the optic radiations, as well as significant correlations between the optic radiations and multiple cortical visual networks. Therefore, fMRI contains rich functional information about activity and connectivity within white matter at rest and during tasks, challenging the conventional practice of taking white-matter signals as noise or artifacts.", "context": {"all": {"count": 17814645, "mean": 9.4686361377368, "rank": 2723380, "pct": 84, "higher_than": 15086177}, "journal": {"count": 10308, "mean": 10.293619712844, "rank": 2734, "pct": 73, "higher_than": 7570}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 278190, "mean": 13.384461166828, "rank": 53108, "pct": 80, "higher_than": 224969}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 189, "mean": 9.6947301587302, "rank": 51, "pct": 73, "higher_than": 139}}, "authors": ["Lauren Marussich", "Kun-Han Lu", "Haiguang Wen", "Zhongming Liu"], "type": "article", "handles": [], "altmetric_id": 12443939, "schema": "1.5.4", "is_oa": false, "publisher_subjects": [{"name": "Medical And Health Sciences", "scheme": "era"}, {"name": "Psychology And Cognitive Sciences", "scheme": "era"}], "cited_by_posts_count": 15, "cited_by_tweeters_count": 15, "cited_by_accounts_count": 15, "last_updated": 1500556373, "score": 8.95, "history": {"1y": 0, "6m": 0, "3m": 0, "1m": 0, "1w": 0, "6d": 0, "5d": 0, "4d": 0, "3d": 0, "2d": 0, "1d": 0, "at": 8.95}, "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.10.005", "added_on": 1475671369, "published_on": 1485907200, "subjects": ["diagnosticimaging"], "scopus_subjects": ["Neuroscience", "Life Sciences"], "readers": {"citeulike": "0", "mendeley": "51", "connotea": "0"}, "readers_count": 51, "images": {"small": "https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=9&types=tttttttt", "medium": "https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=9&types=tttttttt", "large": "https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=9&types=tttttttt"}, "details_url": "http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=12443939"}
