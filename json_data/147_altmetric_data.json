Here we present a targeted, non-invasive drug delivery system to decrease inflammation in an osteoarthritis model. Hollow thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) nanoparticles have been synthesized via degradation of a N,N'-bis(acryloyl)cystamine (BAC) cross-linked core out of a non-degradable pNIPAM shell. Sulfated 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid (AMPSA) was copolymerized in the shell to increase passive loading of an anti-inflammatory mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2)-inhibiting cell-penetrating peptide (KAFAK). The drug-loaded hollow nanoparticles were effective at delivering a therapeutically active dose of KAFAK to bovine cartilage explants, suppressing pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression after interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) stimulation. This thermosensitive hollow nanoparticle system provides an excellent platform for the delivery of peptide therapeutics into highly proteolytic environments such as osteoarthritis.", "context": {"all": {"count": 12283603, "mean": 7.6048132065664, "rank": 10886604, "pct": 1, "higher_than": 0}, "journal": {"count": 6083, "mean": 4.0528161788885, "rank": 5167, "pct": 1, "higher_than": 0}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 265939, "mean": 12.967974768554, "rank": 222682, "pct": 1, "higher_than": 0}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 98, "mean": 2.6762886597938, "rank": 67, "pct": 1, "higher_than": 0}}, "authors": ["James McMasters", "Scott Poh", "Jenny B.
