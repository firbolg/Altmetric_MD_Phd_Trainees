Although originally thought to promote vascular health and integrity, there is a growing body of evidence to support that coronary perivascular adipose tissue displays a distinct phenotype relative to other adipose depots and is capable of producing local factors with the potential to augment coronary vascular tone, inflammation, and the initiation and progression of coronary artery disease. The purpose of the present review is to outline previous findings about the cardiovascular effects of coronary perivascular adipose tissue and the potential mechanisms by which adipose-derived factors may influence coronary vascular function and the progression of atherogenesis.", "abstract_source": "pubmed", "context": {"all": {"count": 12009062, "mean": 7.5143506956782, "rank": 6445408, "pct": 45, "higher_than": 5519016}, "journal": {"count": 4121, "mean": 5.4571412621359, "rank": 2564, "pct": 37, "higher_than": 1540}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 193012, "mean": 7.8590952018281, "rank": 73672, "pct": 61, "higher_than": 118324}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 39, "mean": 9.6757894736842, "rank": 8, "pct": 79, "higher_than": 31}}, "authors": ["Meredith Kohr Owen", "Jillian N.
