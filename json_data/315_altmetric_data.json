Although IL-2 is produced by all polarized Th subsets to some level, how it impacts cytokine production when effector T cells are restimulated is unknown. We show in this article that Golgi transport inhibitors (GTIs) blocked IL-9 production. Mechanistically, GTIs blocked secretion of IL-2 that normally feeds back in a paracrine manner to promote STAT5 activation and IL-9 production. IL-2 feedback had no effect on Th1- or Th17-signature cytokine production, but it promoted Th2- and Th9-associated cytokine expression. These data suggest that the use of GTIs results in an underestimation of the presence of type 2 cytokine-secreting cells and highlight IL-2 as a critical component in optimal cytokine production by Th2 and Th9 cells in vitro and in vivo.", "context": {"all": {"count": 11218844, "mean": 7.220514246777, "rank": 6381109, "pct": 41, "higher_than": 4623758}, "journal": {"count": 8886, "mean": 3.0687729881823, "rank": 4324, "pct": 47, "higher_than": 4247}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 264929, "mean": 12.951250513347, "rank": 125896, "pct": 49, "higher_than": 130576}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 222, "mean": 4.2391131221719, "rank": 146, "pct": 28, "higher_than": 63}}, "authors": ["Matthew R.
