Inhibition of 12/15-LOX provides a potential therapeutic approach to prevent glycemic deterioration in T1D. Two inhibitors recently identified by our groups through screening efforts, ML127 and ML351, have been shown to selectively target 12/15-LOX with high potency. Only ML351 exhibited no apparent toxicity across a range of concentrations in mouse islets, and molecular modeling suggested reduced promiscuity of ML351 compared to ML127. In mouse islets, incubation with ML351 improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines and triggered gene expression pathways responsive to oxidative stress and cell death. Consistent with a role for 12/15-LOX in promoting oxidative stress, its chemical inhibition reduced production of reactive oxygen species in both mouse and human islets in vitro. In a streptozotocin-induced model of T1D in mice, ML351 prevented development of diabetes, with coincident enhancement of nuclear Nrf2 in islet cells, reduced \u03b2-cell oxidative stress, and preservation of \u03b2-cell mass. In the non-obese diabetic mouse model of T1D, administration of ML351 during the pre-diabetic phase prevented dysglycemia, reduced \u03b2-cell oxidative stress, and increased the proportion of anti-inflammatory macrophages in the insulitis. Our data provide the first evidence to date that small molecules that target 12/15-LOX can prevent progression of \u03b2-cell dysfunction and glycemic deterioration in models of T1D.", "context": {"all": {"count": 12473273, "mean": 7.7305037930567, "rank": 2964885, "pct": 76, "higher_than": 9492628}, "journal": {"count": 6912, "mean": 7.3136113442338, "rank": 2055, "pct": 70, "higher_than": 4851}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 263446, "mean": 13.381540442976, "rank": 73757, "pct": 71, "higher_than": 189137}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 89, "mean": 10.250886363636, "rank": 38, "pct": 58, "higher_than": 52}}, "authors": ["Marimar Hernandez-Perez", "Gaurav Chopra", "Jonathan Fine", "Abass M.
