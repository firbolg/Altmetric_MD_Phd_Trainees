An alternative hypothesis is abnormal osteoblast differentiation, resulting in low BFRs due to reduced VEGF-A.\nWe analyzed the expression of VEGF-A and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation factors in freshly isolated bone marrow (BM) cells, and in BM cell-derived MSC in rats with different levels of BFRs and PTH (modulated by calcium and zoledronic acid). The regulators of VEGF in MSC were also determined.\nVEGF-A expression was reduced in the BM cells from CKD vs. normal animals (p < 0.02). In BM-derived MSC from CKD, there were decreased osteoblast transcription factors and mineralization. In CKD animals, the BM VEGF-A expression was positively correlated with BFR (r = 0.80, p < 0.001). Reducing BFRs in CKD animals led to reductions in VEGF-A expression and osteoblast transcription factors regardless of the PTH level. We therefore examined other regulators of VEGF-A and found decreased expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 and the master transcription factor of antioxidants nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 in CKD animals with low PTH.\nLow BFRs in CKD are associated with a basal decrease in VEGF-A expression in BM that may be driven by altered hypoxia and oxidative stress. \u00a9 2015 S.
