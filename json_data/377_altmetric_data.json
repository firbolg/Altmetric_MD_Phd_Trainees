As directly targeting the channel can lead to multiple adverse side effects, targeting modulators of CaV2.2 may prove better. We previously identified ST1-104, a short peptide from the collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), which disrupted the CaV2.2-CRMP2 interaction and suppressed a model of HIV-related neuropathy induced by anti-retroviral therapy but not traumatic neuropathy. Here, we report ST2-104 -a peptide wherein the cell-penetrating TAT motif has been supplanted with a homopolyarginine motif, which dose-dependently inhibits the CaV2.2-CRMP2 interaction and inhibits depolarization-evoked Ca(2+) influx in sensory neurons. Ca(2+) influx via activation of vanilloid receptors is not affected by either peptide. Systemic administration of ST2-104 does not affect thermal or tactile nociceptive behavioral changes. Importantly, ST2-104 transiently reduces persistent mechanical hypersensitivity induced by systemic administration of the anti-retroviral drug 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC) and following tibial nerve injury (TNI). Possible mechanistic explanations for the broader efficacy of ST2-104 are discussed.", "abstract_source": "pubmed", "context": {"all": {"count": 15019833, "mean": 8.6687734151682, "rank": 4366746, "pct": 70, "higher_than": 10560203}, "journal": {"count": 6330, "mean": 4.3134476220572, "rank": 1693, "pct": 72, "higher_than": 4609}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 152621, "mean": 6.9670346088326, "rank": 41566, "pct": 71, "higher_than": 109130}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 51, "mean": 2.19084, "rank": 8, "pct": 84, "higher_than": 43}}, "authors": ["Weina Ju", "Qi Li", "Yohance M.
