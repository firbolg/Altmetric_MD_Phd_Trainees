Nevertheless, the contribution of embryonic progenitors to JMML pathogenesis remains unexplored. We hypothesized that expression of JMML-initiating PTPN11 mutations in HSC-independent yolk sac erythromyeloid progenitors (YS EMPs) would result in a mouse model of pediatric myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN).\nE9.5 YS EMPs from VavCre+;PTPN11(D61Y) embryos demonstrated growth hypersensitivity to GM-CSF and hyperactive RAS-ERK signaling. Mutant EMPs engrafted the spleens of neonatal recipients, but did not cause disease. To assess MPN development during unperturbed hematopoiesis we generated CSF1R-MCM+;PTPN11(E76K) ;ROSA(YFP) mice in which oncogene expression was restricted to EMPs. YFP+ progeny of mutant EMPs persisted in tissues one year after birth and demonstrated hyperactive RAS-ERK signaling. Nevertheless, these mice had normal survival and did not demonstrate features of MPN.\nYS EMPs expressing mutant PTPN11 demonstrate functional and molecular features of JMML but do not cause disease following transplantation nor following unperturbed development.
