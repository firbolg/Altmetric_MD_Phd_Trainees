We propose a conceptual framework involving the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2), A\u03b2 precursor protein (APP), and fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) based on experimental evidence. The anabolic (growth-promoting) effect of the secreted \u03b1 form of the amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (sAPP\u03b1) may contribute to the state of brain overgrowth implicated in autism and FXS. Our previous report demonstrated that higher plasma sAPP\u03b1 levels associate with more severe symptoms of autism, including aggression. This molecular effect could contribute to intellectual disability due to repression of cell-cell adhesion, promotion of dense, long, thin dendritic spines, and the potential for disorganized brain structure as a result of disrupted neurogenesis and migration. At the molecular level, APP and FMRP are linked via the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). Specifically, mGluR5 activation releases FMRP repression of APP mRNA translation and stimulates sAPP secretion. The relatively lower sAPP\u03b1 level in AD may contribute to AD symptoms that significantly contrast with those of FXS and autism. Low sAPP\u03b1 and production of insoluble A\u03b2 would favor a degenerative process, with the brain atrophy seen in AD. Treatment with mGluR antagonists may help repress APP mRNA translation and reduce secretion of sAPP in FXS and perhaps autism.", "abstract_source": "pubmed", "context": {"all": {"count": 17583573, "mean": 9.4154992438673, "rank": 2296580, "pct": 86, "higher_than": 15272178}, "journal": {"count": 16956, "mean": 17.020427577259, "rank": 4197, "pct": 74, "higher_than": 12681}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 222241, "mean": 10.102233944232, "rank": 33842, "pct": 84, "higher_than": 188052}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 238, "mean": 19.52568907563, "rank": 69, "pct": 71, "higher_than": 170}}, "authors": ["D.
