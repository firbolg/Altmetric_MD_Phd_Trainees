The in vivo role of abnormal cell division in FA remains unknown. Here, we quantified the origins of genomic instability in FA patients and mice in vivo and ex vivo. We found that both mitotic errors and interphase DNA damage significantly contribute to genomic instability during FA-deficient hematopoiesis and in non-hematopoietic human and murine FA primary cells. Super-resolution microscopy coupled with functional assays revealed that FANCA shuttles to the pericentriolar material (PCM) to regulate spindle assembly at mitotic entry. Loss of FA signaling rendered cells hypersensitive to spindle chemotherapeutics and allowed escape from the chemotherapy-induced spindle assembly checkpoint. In support of these findings, direct comparison of DNA cross-linking and antimitotic chemotherapeutics in primary FANCA-/- cells revealed genomic instability originating through divergent cell cycle checkpoint aberrations. Our data indicate that the FA/BRCA signaling functions as an in vivo gatekeeper of genomic integrity throughout interphase and mitosis, which may have implications for future targeted therapies in FA and FA-deficient cancers.", "context": {"all": {"count": 14353015, "mean": 8.3888925620696, "rank": 3979744, "pct": 72, "higher_than": 10341409}, "journal": {"count": 1258, "mean": 3.4982195704057, "rank": 311, "pct": 75, "higher_than": 947}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 242303, "mean": 9.5789789023615, "rank": 65916, "pct": 72, "higher_than": 175450}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 24, "mean": 2.0608695652174, "rank": 5, "pct": 79, "higher_than": 19}}, "authors": ["Zahi Abdul-Sater", "Donna Cerabona", "Elizabeth Sierra Potchanant", "Zejin Sun", "Rikki Enzor", "Ying He", "Kent Robertson", "W.
