The KV channels responsible have not been identified, but KV7channels are possible candidates. Existing data regarding KV7 channel function in the coronary circulation (limited to ex vivo assessments) are mixed. Thus, we examined the hypothesis that KV7 channels are present in cells of the coronary vascular wall and regulate vasodilation in swine. We performed a variety of molecular, biochemical, and functional (in vivo and ex vivo) studies. Coronary arteries expressed KCNQ genes (qPCR) and KV7.4 protein (Western blot). Immunostaining demonstrated KV7.4 expression in conduit and resistance vessels, perhaps most prominently in the endothelial and adventitial layers. Flupirtine, a KV7 opener, relaxed coronary artery rings and this was attenuated by linopirdine, a KV7 blocker. Endothelial denudation inhibited the flupirtine-induced and linopirdine-sensitive relaxation of coronary artery rings. Moreover, linopirdine diminished bradykinin-induced endothelial-dependent relaxation of coronary artery rings. There was no effect of intracoronary flupirtine or linopirdine on coronary blood flow at the resting heart rate in vivo. Linopirdine had no effect on coronary vasodilation in vivo elicited by ischemia, H2O2, or tachycardia. However, bradykinin increased coronary blood flow in vivo and this was attenuated by linopirdine. These data indicate that KV7 channels are expressed in some coronary cell type(s) and influence endothelial function. Other physiological functions of coronary vascular KV7 channels remain unclear, but they do appear to contribute to endothelial-dependent responses to paracrine stimuli.", "context": {"all": {"count": 13465676, "mean": 8.0882571744706, "rank": 10274842, "pct": 20, "higher_than": 2751095}, "journal": {"count": 2702, "mean": 3.9831603109959, "rank": 2018, "pct": 19, "higher_than": 535}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 267876, "mean": 11.75825178908, "rank": 172109, "pct": 30, "higher_than": 80462}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 93, "mean": 2.1672608695652, "rank": 69, "pct": 13, "higher_than": 13}}, "authors": ["Adam G.
