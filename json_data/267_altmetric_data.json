The underlying pathologic mechanisms remain largely unknown. Using Asxl1-targeted murine models, we found that Asxl1 global loss as well as conditional deletion in osteoblasts and their progenitors led to significant bone loss and a markedly decreased number of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) compared with wild-type littermates. Asxl1(-/-) BMSCs displayed impaired self-renewal and skewed differentiation, away from osteoblasts and favoring adipocytes. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed altered expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, skeletal development, and morphogenesis. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis showed decreased expression of stem cell self-renewal gene signature, suggesting a role of Asxl1 in regulating the stemness of BMSCs. Importantly, re-introduction of Asxl1 normalized NANOG and OCT4 expression and restored the self-renewal capacity of Asxl1(-/-) BMSCs. Our study unveils a pivotal role of ASXL1 in the maintenance of BMSC functions and skeletal development.", "context": {"all": {"count": 13486122, "mean": 8.0941620176652, "rank": 891379, "pct": 93, "higher_than": 12594940}, "journal": {"count": 1275, "mean": 21.177797488226, "rank": 293, "pct": 77, "higher_than": 982}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 267016, "mean": 12.073903765706, "rank": 25572, "pct": 90, "higher_than": 241441}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 43, "mean": 24.304285714286, "rank": 7, "pct": 83, "higher_than": 36}}, "authors": ["Peng Zhang", "Caihong Xing", "Steven D.
