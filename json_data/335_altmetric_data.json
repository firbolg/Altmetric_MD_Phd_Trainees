Stimulation of Dectin-1 and complement receptor 3 (CR3) activates Erk- and Akt-dependent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Shp2, a protein tyrosine phosphatase encoded by Ptpn11, promotes activation of Ras-Erk and PI3K-Akt and is crucial for hematopoietic cell function; however, no studies have examined Shp2 function in particulate-stimulated ROS production. Maximal Dectin-1-stimulated ROS production corresponded kinetically to maximal Shp2 and Erk phosphorylation. Bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs) from mice with a conditionally deleted allele of Ptpn11 (Shp2flox/flox;Mx1Cre+) produced significantly lower ROS levels compared to control BMMs. Although yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged phosphatase dead Shp2-C463A was strongly recruited to the early phagosome, its expression inhibited Dectin-1- and CR3-stimulated phospho-Erk and ROS levels, placing Shp2 phosphatase function and Erk activation upstream of ROS production. Further, BMMs expressing gain-of-function (GOF) Shp2-D61Y or Shp2-E76K and peritoneal exudate macrophages (PEMs) from Shp2D61Y/+;Mx1Cre+ mice produced significantly elevated levels of Dectin-1- and CR3-stimulated ROS which was reduced by pharmacologic inhibition of Erk. Signal regulatory protein\u03b1 (SIRP\u03b1) is a myeloid inhibitory immunoreceptor that requires tyrosine phosphorylation to exert its inhibitory effect. YFP-Shp2C463A-expressing cells have elevated phospho-SIRP\u03b1 levels and an increased Shp2-SIRP\u03b1 interaction compared to YFP-WT Shp2-expressing cells. Collectively, these findings indicate that Shp2 phosphatase function positively regulates Dectin-1- and CR3-stimulated ROS production in macrophages by de-phosphorylating and thus mitigating the inhibitory function of SIRP\u03b1 and by promoting Erk activation.", "abstract_source": "pubmed", "authors": ["Xing Jun Li", "Charles B Goodwin", "Sarah C.
