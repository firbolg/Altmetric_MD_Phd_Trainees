The goal of this study was to determine if raloxifene-induced alterations in skeletal hydration could be measured in vivo using ultra-short echotime magnetic resonance imaging (UTE-MRI). Twelve skeletally mature female beagle dogs (n\u2009=\u20096/group) were treated for 6 months with oral doses of saline vehicle (VEH, 1\u2009ml/kg/day) or raloxifene (RAL, 0.5\u2009mg/kg/day). Following six months of treatment, all animals underwent in vivo UTE-MRI of the proximal tibial cortical bone. UTE-MRI signal intensity versus echotime curves were analyzed by fitting a double exponential to determine the short and long relaxation times of water with the bone (dependent estimations of bound and free water, respectively). Raloxifene-treated animals had significantly higher bound water (+14%; p\u2009=\u20090.05) and lower free water (-20%) compared to vehicle-treated animals. These data provide the first evidence that drug-induced changes in skeletal hydration can be non-invasively assessed using UTE-MRI. This article is protected by copyright.
