To release insulin, \u03b2-cells require soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes, as well as SNARE complex regulatory proteins like Double C2-domain protein \u03b2 (DOC2B). We hypothesized that DOC2B deficiency or overabundance may confer susceptibility or protection, respectively, to the functional \u03b2-cell mass. Indeed, Doc2b+/- knockout mice show an unusually severe response to multiple-low-dose streptozotocin (MLD-STZ), resulting in more apoptotic \u03b2-cells and a smaller \u03b2-cell mass. In addition, inducible \u03b2-cell-specific Doc2b-overexpressing transgenic (\u03b2Doc2b-dTg) mice show improved glucose tolerance and resist MLD-STZ-induced disruption of glucose tolerance, fasting hyperglycemia, \u03b2-cell apoptosis, and loss of \u03b2-cell mass. Mechanistically, DOC2B enrichment enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and SNARE activation, and prevents the appearance of apoptotic markers in response to cytokine stress and thapsigargin. Furthermore, expression of a peptide containing the DOC2B tandem C2A and C2B domains is sufficient to confer the beneficial effects of DOC2B enrichment on GSIS, SNARE activation, and apoptosis. These studies demonstrate that DOC2B enrichment in the \u03b2-cell protects against diabetogenic and pro-apoptotic stress. Furthermore, they identify a DOC2B peptide that confers the beneficial effects of DOC2B and may be a therapeutic candidate for protecting functional \u03b2-cell mass.", "context": {"all": {"count": 13118813, "mean": 7.9599309103468, "rank": 10456984, "pct": 11, "higher_than": 1466671}, "journal": {"count": 7133, "mean": 7.4784178351094, "rank": 6454, "pct": 4, "higher_than": 295}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 269785, "mean": 14.266442984017, "rank": 202544, "pct": 13, "higher_than": 35118}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 175, "mean": 16.788195402299, "rank": 144, "pct": 9, "higher_than": 17}}, "authors": ["Arianne Aslamy", "Eunjin Oh", "Erika M.
