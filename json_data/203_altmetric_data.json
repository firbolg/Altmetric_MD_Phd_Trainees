Gallium nitride (GaN) is a material with remarkable properties, including excellent chemical stability. This work demonstrated that functionalized and etched GaN surfaces were stable in aqueous environments and leached a negligible amount of Ga in solution even in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Also, GaN surfaces in cell culture did not interfere with nearby cell growth, and etched GaN promoted the adhesion of cells compared to etched silicon surfaces. A model peptide, \"IKVAV\", covalently attached to GaN and silicon surfaces increased the adhesion of PC12 cells. Peptide terminated GaN promoted greater cell spreading and extension of neurites. The results suggest that peptide modified GaN is a biocompatible and non-toxic material that can be used to probe chemical and electrical stimuli associated with neural interfaces.", "abstract_source": "pubmed", "context": {"all": {"count": 18957622, "mean": 9.6167787724634, "rank": 1372412, "pct": 92, "higher_than": 17572348}, "journal": {"count": 3528, "mean": 5.8666836734694, "rank": 123, "pct": 96, "higher_than": 3403}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 126792, "mean": 7.3521815887439, "rank": 7867, "pct": 93, "higher_than": 118817}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 22, "mean": 3.889, "rank": 1, "pct": 99, "higher_than": 22}}, "authors": ["Scott A.
