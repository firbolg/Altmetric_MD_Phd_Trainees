Pathogenic reductions in \u03b2 cell ER Ca2+ have been observed in diabetes. However, a role for impaired SOCE in this phenotype has not been tested. We measured expression of SOCE molecular components in human and rodent models of diabetes and found a specific reduction in STIM1 mRNA and protein levels in human islets from donors with type 2 diabetes (T2D), islets from hyperglycemic streptozotocin-treated mice, and INS-1 cells treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines and palmitate. Pharmacologic SOCE inhibitors led to impaired islet Ca2+ oscillations and insulin secretion, and these effects were phenocopied by \u03b2 cell STIM1 deletion. STIM1 deletion also led to reduced ER Ca2+ storage and increased ER stress, while STIM1 gain of function rescued \u03b2 cell survival under pro-inflammatory conditions and improved insulin secretion in human islets from donors with T2D. Taken together, these data suggest that loss of STIM1 and impaired SOCE contribute to ER Ca2+ dyshomeostasis under diabetic conditions, while efforts to restore SOCE-mediated Ca2+ transients may have potential to improve \u03b2 cell health and function.", "context": {"all": {"count": 17819859, "mean": 9.4685622470946, "rank": 2143187, "pct": 87, "higher_than": 15673452}, "journal": {"count": 8314, "mean": 8.2713620399327, "rank": 1121, "pct": 86, "higher_than": 7194}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 285629, "mean": 13.912938112026, "rank": 51505, "pct": 82, "higher_than": 234231}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 67, "mean": 9.5540895522388, "rank": 21, "pct": 70, "higher_than": 47}}, "authors": ["Tatsuyoshi Kono", "Xin Tong", "Solaema Taleb", "Robert N.
