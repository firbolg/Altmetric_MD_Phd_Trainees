NF1 (Nf1) haploinsufficient osteoclasts and osteoclast progenitors derived from both NF1 patients and Nf1(+/-) mice exhibit increased differentiation, migration, and bone resorptive capacity in vitro, mediated by hyperactivation of p21(Ras) in response to limiting concentrations of macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF). Here, we show that M-CSF binding to its receptor, c-Fms, results in increased c-Fms activation in Nf1(+/) (-) osteoclast progenitors, mediating multiple gain-in-functions through the downstream effectors Erk1/2 and p90RSK. PLX3397, a potent and selective c-Fms inhibitor, attenuated M-CSF mediated Nf1(+/-) osteoclast migration by 50%, adhesion by 70%, and pit formation by 60%. In vivo, we administered PLX3397 to Nf1(+/-) osteoporotic mice induced by ovariectomy (OVX) and evaluated changes in bone mass and skeletal architecture. We found that PLX3397 prevented bone loss in Nf1(+/-)-OVX mice by reducing osteoclast differentiation and bone resorptive activity in vivo. Collectively, these results implicate the M-CSF/c-Fms signaling axis as a critical pathway underlying the aberrant functioning of Nf1 haploinsufficient osteoclasts and may provide a potential therapeutic target for treating NF1 associated osteoporosis and osteopenia.", "abstract_source": "pubmed", "context": {"all": {"count": 12105155, "mean": 7.5430221659162, "rank": 6957192, "pct": 40, "higher_than": 4914297}, "journal": {"count": 133173, "mean": 11.558209893972, "rank": 68136, "pct": 45, "higher_than": 60169}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 121811, "mean": 6.3876772678763, "rank": 59910, "pct": 48, "higher_than": 58893}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 4252, "mean": 8.3920597506469, "rank": 2005, "pct": 48, "higher_than": 2076}}, "authors": ["Yongzheng He", "Steven D.
